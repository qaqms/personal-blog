# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features that make building web applications easier and more efficient.

## App Router

The App Router is the new way to build applications in Next.js. It uses a file-system based router built on React Server Components.

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>;
}
```

## Server Components

Server Components allow you to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript sent to the client.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 14 project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up everything you need to start building!
