# TypeScript Best Practices

Writing clean, type-safe TypeScript code is essential for maintainable applications.

## Use Strict Mode

Always enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Prefer Interfaces for Object Types

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

## Use Type Guards

Type guards help narrow down types at runtime:

```typescript
function isString(value: unknown): value is string {
  return typeof value === 'string';
}
```

## Conclusion

Following these practices will make your TypeScript code more robust and easier to maintain.
