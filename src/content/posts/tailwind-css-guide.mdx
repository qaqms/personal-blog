# Building Modern UIs with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling fast and intuitive.

## Utility Classes

Instead of writing custom CSS, you use pre-existing classes:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click me
</button>
```

## Responsive Design

Tailwind makes responsive design easy with breakpoint prefixes:

```html
<div class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
  Responsive text
</div>
```

## Dark Mode

Enable dark mode with the `dark:` prefix:

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800">
  Dark mode support
</div>
```

## Why Tailwind?

- **Speed**: Write styles directly in your HTML
- **Consistency**: Design tokens ensure visual harmony
- **Maintainability**: No CSS bloat from unused styles
